Subject: Customer Incident Report â€“ Internal Only

Hi team,

Following the deployment issue on May 12, here are the remediation steps and sensitive credentials we used to resolve the outage. Please ensure this is **not** shared externally.

Temporary S3 access credentials for support@acme.corp:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = AKIAEXAMPLEINTERNAL
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

Postmortem notes:
- Root cause was missing IAM policy in the CI role
- Token was injected directly via env for hotfix
- Scheduled cleanup for Monday May 15
